## Flow Q-Learning (FQL) in PyTorch

This repository houses a minimal implementation of [Flow Q-Learning (FQL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02538), an offine reinforcement learning algorithm.

Note that the paper's authors have published [their official implementation](https://github.com/seohongpark/fql/tree/master), which is based on JAX. I converted it to PyTorch for an ongoing project, and will update this implementation with D4RL benchmark scores in due time.
