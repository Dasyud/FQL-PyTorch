## Flow Q-Learning (FQL) in PyTorch

This repository houses a minimal implementation of Flow Q-Learning (FQL), an offine reinforcement learning algorithm.

Note that the paper's authors have published their official implementation, which is based on JAX. I converted it to PyTorch for an ongoing project, and will update this implementation with D4RL benchmark scores in due time.
